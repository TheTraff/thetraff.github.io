During my time at TicketBiscuit as an intern, I had the opportunity to work on a project that would get significant use from the company's customers, albeit without them knowing about it. Because of this, the code had be very reliable, which is why we went with an all AWS architecture. 

  The project consisted of creating a dynamic image resizing API that could be used for images on print-at-home tickets. The main idea was to put an AWS lambda function that took an image from storage, resized it to the desired size, and return that from an API call. While that is a very simplified version of the project, that gives you the gneral idea.
