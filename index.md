<h1><span style="color: #3B444B">hello there</span></h1>
Welcome to my personal webpage. I made this to have a place to display all the good things about me. If you're 
here, hopefully that means you're thinking about offering my a job. That would be greatly appreciated. 

I'm a senior CS student at the University of Alabama where I'm on track to graduate in December of 2017. When I started as a freshman, I was dead set on getting a bachelors degree in Physics, because I thought I enjoyed and that I was good at it. Unfortunately I found neither of those to be true as I struggled through the classes. long story short, I swithed my major to Computer Science a couple of semesters ago, and I've enjoyed my time much more. If you want to learn more about my experience, check it out <a href="experience">here</a>. If you want to take a look at my resume, you can see that <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>
