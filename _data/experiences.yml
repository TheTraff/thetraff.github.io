- name: Software Engineering Intern - TicketBiscuit
  description: Worked with another intern to design and develop a dynamic image resizing API that is used on print-at-home ticket layouts.
               The project replaced an old in-house web server in order to save money and update the architecture.
               The project utilized an AWS lambda function, API gateway, and a Cloudfront distribution to implement a serverless architecture.
